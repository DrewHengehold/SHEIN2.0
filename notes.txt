Ok, this is a notes file for the future to keep us on track

- We need a javascript file that takes our database, generates a table which can act as a catalog 
for all our products

- We also need a javascript file that will generate a page so that when you click on a product
a new page will pop up with all the product details and a button that says add to cart

- We also need a javascript file that stores your cart in the database, this should be stored in
orders and should be logged as not completed, then when you check out, it is completed and 
becomes unchangeable, therefore the javascript should check if its uncompleted before adding to a 
cart, if it is uncompleted, then add it, if not, then create a new cart/order

- We also need a javascript file that prints out shipping details, perferably in a new page,
idk how we do all the database interraction stuff

- We should also have a javascript file that updates the password and username when people make
them, when user hit the button shopping cart, we should immediately make them sign in, and
that will all be handled by the script
